# React Practice

This is a repository covering the main React features and functionality from the official React documentation.
The repository provides different code examples for both functional and class components.

## CSS

TailwindCSS is configured for the application and can therefore be readily used within the application.

## Contribution

To contribute to the repository, you can follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.
Also feel free to add on the existing documentation on how to better cover the React concepts. This may be by fixing errors on the documentation or totally introducing a new section.

## Source Folder

### advanced

This is the folder dedicated for advanced React features and functionalities as included in the official React documentation. Feel free to add content on the existing files or create a different file within the folder to cover other concepts not included yet.

### components

This folder contains concepts from the Main Concepts section in the official React documentation. All the components in this folder are class based. Feel free to edit the existing code base. You can add other folders within the folder to cover any other missing content. Comments are highly encouraged to clarify on the inclusions ofr the changes that you've made.

### functional

This folder covers the Main Concepts from the documentation but with functions.

### mini

This is the most versatile folder of all as you can include any mini project of your liking. It could be as relatively simple as a timer or you could make it as advanced as you'd like. Also feel free to add more features to the existing mini projects. To practice your documentation skills, remember to document the changes you've made in the mini projects section under the specific project that you've workded on.
Only documented changes will be merged with the main project.

### hooks

The directory id focused on covering the major React hooks. You can improve on the existing code base or add other examples to cover the hooks more widely.

## Mini Projects

These are the currently available mini projects.

## Testing The Application
